This repository contains research focused on Bitcoin price prediction using advanced time-series forecasting models. Three approaches—Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)—are evaluated on historical Bitcoin price data. The Seq2Seq model emerged as the most accurate, achieving 96.21%, followed by ARIMA at 94.2% and LSTM at 87.34%. The study underscores the Seq2Seq model's effectiveness in handling sequential data patterns for cryptocurrency analysis.

Highlights:

Dataset: Sourced from Kaggle, containing historical Bitcoin price attributes.
Preprocessing: MinMaxScaler normalization for consistent scaling.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, MSE, and MAPE.
Conclusion: Seq2Seq demonstrates superior accuracy for volatile market predictions.
Keywords: Bitcoin, Deep Learning, Seq2Seq, LSTM, ARIMA, Cryptocurrency, Time-Series Analysis
